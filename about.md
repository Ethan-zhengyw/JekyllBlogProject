Hello! My name is Yiwang Zheng, welcome here! I Graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University with a degree in software engineer. For the last two years, I have been working as a cloud computing engineer. Iâ€™m familiar with architecture of cloud service and its deployment. I develop micro services, containerize them and build CICD pipelines. And I have large interest in DevOps and keep learning relative skills now.
