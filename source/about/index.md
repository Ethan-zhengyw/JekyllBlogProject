Hello, welcome to yiwang's blog! My name is Yiwang Zheng, I have been working as a cloud computing engineer for two years. I develop API of backend service, containerize them and build CI/CD pipelines for these micro-service. Iâ€™m familiar with architecture of cloud service and its deployment. And I have large interest in architecting for cloud, therefore keep learning relative skills now.
